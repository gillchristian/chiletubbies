This is just a small app I made for fun using [Angular]() filters.

I was laughing with my gf about Chile people ending phrases with the tag _po_, and we said _what if instead Po they used anothers Teletubbies name?_, and that's pretty much where the idea comes from :smile:

The filter changes any occurrences of _po_, _poo_ or _poh_ for any random name of one of the Teletubbies.
